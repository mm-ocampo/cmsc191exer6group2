Steps:
1. Make sure that your WAMP/LAMP and couchdb.bat are running in your devices.

2. Create a db in your couchdb named "cmsc191-exer6-db" and import cmsc191-exer6-db.json from the dump folder.

3. Go to http://localhost/cmsc191exer6group2/couchDB/ to test if the connection is working.

4. To know if its properly working, go to the couchDB/screenshots/ and view 'connection-established.png'

5. Congratulations for the successful installation! :)
